# Lesson 003 Review: Obligation & Nature

## User Performance Summary
The user successfully integrated the causal connector `-아/어/여서` with the new obligation grammar `-아/어/여야 되다`. They demonstrated a strong understanding of the logical distinction between different types of "wearing" in Korean (입다 vs 쓰다). The user proactively requested more thorough grammar explanations and updates to the cheatsheet to include vowel contraction rules. Spelling remains the primary area for growth, particularly with vowel choices in complex conjugations (e.g., 마셔야, 청소해야).

## Score: 7.5/10
*   **Grammar:** 9/10 - Excellent application of obligation rules and irregular verb handling (걷다).
*   **Vocabulary:** 7/10 - Good use of Nature/Weather roots, minor confusion between "bad" and "high" for temperature.
*   **Logical Application:** 8/10 - Correctly identified when to use specific wearing verbs based on the object.
