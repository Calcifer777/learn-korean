# Lesson 022 Review

## Performance
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Summary:** The user tackled a challenging lesson involving Indirect Quotation and Sequencing. The logic for sequencing (`-(으)ㄴ 후에`) is solid. The distinction between quoting Adjectives (`-다고`) and Action Verbs (`-ㄴ/는다고`) is understood but requires careful application to avoid mixing up the forms (e.g., `먹다고` vs `먹는다고`). Spelling of new vocabulary (미역, 낳다, 태어나다) is improving.

## Concepts Mastered
- **Indirect Quotation (Statements):** `-다고 하다` (Adj), `-ㄴ/는다고 하다` (Verb), `-(이)라고 하다` (Noun).
- **Sequencing:** `-(으)ㄴ 후에`.
- **Hanja Roots:** 生 (생), 感 (감), 謝 (사), 後 (후).
- **Cultural Context:** Seaweed soup tradition.

## Areas for Improvement
- **Action Verb Quotation:** Remembering the "skeleton" form (`-ㄴ/는다`) before adding `-고`.
- **Irregular Verbs in Quotes:** `ㄹ` irregulars (`만든다고`, `산다고`).
