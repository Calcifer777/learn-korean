# Lesson 001 Review: Continuous Tense & Home Life

## User Performance Summary
The user demonstrated a solid understanding of the grammar point `-고 있다` (Continuous Tense), correctly applying it in both present and past forms. The primary area for improvement is vocabulary precision, specifically vowel accuracy (e.g., 가족 vs 가죽, 지금 vs 자금) and consistent use of Hanja-based roots (e.g., 실 for rooms). The user is successfully integrating the logical priming into their sentence construction, though they still rely on phonetic approximations at times.

## Score: 7/10
*   **Grammar:** 9/10 - Excellent application of the target conjugation.
*   **Vocabulary:** 5/10 - Frequent vowel swaps and minor spelling errors.
*   **Logical Application:** 7/10 - Good attempt at using Hanja roots, with some minor confusion between similar-sounding words.
