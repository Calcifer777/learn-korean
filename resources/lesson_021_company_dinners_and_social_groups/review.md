# Lesson 021 Review

## Performance
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Summary:** The user demonstrated a solid grasp of the simultaneous action connector `-(으)면서` and the group particle `끼리`. Spelling for family-related words (가족, 초대, 저녁) remains an area for practice, but the logical application of the new grammar was excellent. The user correctly handled the ㄷ-irregular for "walking" and "listening."

## Concepts Mastered
- **Simultaneous Actions:** `V + -(으)면서`.
- **Group Exclusivity:** `N + 끼리`.
- **Hanja Roots:** 會 (회), 全 (전), 體 (체).
- **Social Context:** 회식, 회사, 초대.
