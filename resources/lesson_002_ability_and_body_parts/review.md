# Lesson 002 Review: Ability & Body Parts

## User Performance Summary
The user showed a very fast grasp of the modal structure `-(으)ㄹ 수 있다/없다` and correctly identified the underlying logic of `수` as a dependent noun meaning "way/possibility." They also successfully navigated the causal connector `-아/어/여서`, which was introduced mid-lesson. Vocabulary accuracy is improving, though the user still struggles with vowel precision (e.g., `ㅓ` vs `ㅏ`) and occasionally doubles up on particles (e.g., `누니가` instead of `눈이`). Their proactive request to increase guided practice rounds indicates high engagement and a desire for structural mastery.

## Score: 8/10
*   **Grammar:** 9/10 - Strong grasp of complex modal and causal structures.
*   **Vocabulary:** 7/10 - Improved root usage, though spelling remains the primary hurdle.
*   **Logical Application:** 10/10 - Excellent curiosity regarding the etymology of grammar particles.
