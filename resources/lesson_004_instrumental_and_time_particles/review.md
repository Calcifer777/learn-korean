# Lesson 004 Review

**Score: 8/10**

## Summary
Focus: Instrumental Particle (`-(으)로`), Time Ranges (`-부터`, `-까지`), and Duration (`-동안`).
Vocabulary: Transportation and Places.

## Strengths
- **Particle Placement:** Excellent understanding of where to attach `-부터`, `-까지`, and `-로`.
- **Sentence Structure:** SOV order is becoming very natural.
- **Method vs. Destination:** Clear distinction between "Via X" and "To Y".

## Weaknesses
- **Vowel Accuracy:** Confusion between `ㅓ` (cup) and `ㅏ`. (e.g., `컵` vs `캅`).
- **Time Counters:** Confusing `시` (Point in time) with `시간` (Duration).
- **Particles:** Using `-한테` (To a person) instead of `-하고` (With a person).

## Action Items
- Review "Time Counters" (Native numbers + 시간).
- Practice differentiating "With" particles (`하고/이랑`) from "To" particles (`한테/에게`).
