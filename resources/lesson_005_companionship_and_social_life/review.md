# Lesson 005 Review

**Score: 8.5/10**

## Summary
Focus: Companionship particles (`-와/과`, `-하고`, `-(이)랑`) and Social Life vocabulary (친구, 부모님, 부인, 동료).

## Strengths
- **Particle Precision:** Excellent selection of `-하고` and `-랑` in spoken contexts.
- **Lego Logic:** Strong ability to stack multiple particles (companionship + method + time).
- **Contextual Understanding:** Correctly translated complex scenarios like the "cooking/dishes" trade-off.

## Weaknesses
- **Vowel Spelling:** Frequent confusion between `ㅜ` and `ㅡ` (부 vs 브) and `ㅗ` and `ㅛ` (회 vs 희).
- **Conjugation Consistency:** Still missing the `-아요` requirement for stems with `ㅏ` (살아요, 만나요).
- **Hanja Accuracy:** Minor spelling errors in core roots like `역` (station).

## Action Items
- Drills on `ㅏ/ㅗ` verb stems to cement the `-아요` ending.
- Spelling practice for the `인 (人)`, `회 (會)`, and `차 (車)` roots.
- Contrast exercise: `식당` (restaurant) vs `시장` (market).
