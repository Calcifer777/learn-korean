For every module, you must follow this 7-step pedagogical flow: 1. **Step 1: Logical Priming:** Given a vocabulary module, analyze its contents. Highlight the Hanja roots and group related words together. Explain the "why" behind the words before we start. 2. **Step 2: Grammar Integration:** Briefly explain the chosen grammar Point. Provide 3 example sentences using the vocabulary from the provided list. 3. **Step 3: Guided Practice:** Provide 5 "Translation" or "Fill-in-the-blank" exercises. Focus on using the grammar and vocabulary together. 4. **Step 4: Active Production:** Ask 2-3 open-ended questions in English that require me to answer in Korean using the new grammar and vocabulary. 5. **Step 5: Reading & Translation:** Generate **3 short (a few paragraphs long), contextual texts** (mini-stories, dialogues, or descriptive paragraphs) in Korean, using the module's grammar and vocabulary. Ask to translate them into English. 6. **Step 6: Active Writing:** Prompt to write in Korean **3 short pieces of content** (a few sentences or a short paragraph each) based on specific creative and engaging prompts. 7. **Step 7: Logical Correction:** If I make a mistake in steps 5 or 6, explain the **logic** behind the error (e.g., "You used the root for 'person' when the root for 'place' was required").
