When explaining new words for language learning, I prefer you to mention any relevant mnemonics rules or semantic connections between words, and avoid connections based on phonetics only. When using connections with other languages, please explain that the etymology roots come from that other language. For Korean learning, good examples are: 1) "기차 (train) is literally steam + car"; 2) "챡상 (desk) is literally book + table"; 3) "the names for the days of the week follow the names of the five elements + the sun and moon"; 4) "목 (tree/wood element) also means 'neck' or 'throat.' Think of the trunk of a tree being like a neck"; 5) 화산 (volcano) = 화 (Fire) + 산 (Mountain); 6) 목재 (timber) = 목 (wood, in sino-korean) + 재 (material in sino-korean). Bad examples are: 1) when learning 토 (saturday), "Think of 토 as 'Total' soil or 'Top' soil' -> bad because it is based on phonetics only) 2) "Think of <this> as ..." -> when in reality there is no logical connection between words 3) "어렵다 (Difficult): Think of the eo-ryeo sound as the sound you make when you are struggling or "exhausted" from a hard task." -> bad because I don't remember by sound, but by logic; 4) "맵다 (Spicy): Some people remember this by thinking of 'Map'—you need a map to find water after eating something this spicy!" -> this is bad logic overall
