# Schematic Framework: The 'Human SRS' Chat Protocol

**Target:** Maximizing Sentence Comprehension & Retention without Flashcards  
**Medium:** Text Chat Only (No audio calls, no Anki)

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: "Input Flooding" & "Active Construction"
Instead of reviewing isolated cards, the student retains information by:
* **Input Flooding:** Encountering target vocabulary repeatedly in varied, natural sentence contexts.
* **Active Construction:** Being forced to build sentences immediately using newly acquired patterns.

## 2. The Teacher's Role: The "Invisible" Scheduler
The teacher manages the **Forgetting Curve** manually within the chat flow.

* **The Tracking Sheet (Teacher Internal):** A simple spreadsheet/doc to track "Active Vocabulary" and "Grammar Patterns."
* **The Re-Injection Protocol:**
    * **T+0 (First Encounter):** Introduce word/grammar; use it immediately.
    * **T+10 (Same Session):** Ask a question requiring that word 10 minutes later.
    * **T+24h (Next Session):** Start the next chat with a casual question involving that word.
    * **T+7d (Consolidation):** "Input Flood" the word in a new context one week later.

## 3. Chat-Based Drills (The "Engine")
These three drills replace flashcards and focus on **syntax** rather than word isolation.

### Drill A: "Snowballing" (Sentence Expansion)
**Goal:** Understanding Korean SOV structure and particle stacking.
1. Teacher types a root word.
2. Student writes a basic sentence.
3. Teacher adds constraints (adjectives, adverbs, time markers).

> **Chat Log Example:**
> * **Teacher:** 사과 (Apple)
> * **Student:** 저는 사과를 먹어요. (I eat an apple.)
> * **Teacher:** + 맛있는 (Delicious)
> * **Student:** 저는 맛있는 사과를 먹어요. (I eat a delicious apple.)
> * **Teacher:** + 어제 (Yesterday) -> *Force Past Tense*
> * **Student:** 저는 어제 맛있는 사과를 먹었어요. (I ate a delicious apple yesterday.)

### Drill B: "Cloze-in-Chat" (Contextual Recall)
**Goal:** Testing particles and vocabulary in context.
The teacher provides a sentence with a missing component (`___`).

> **Chat Log Example:**
> * **Teacher:** 우리는 내일 도서관__ 갈 거예요. (We will go [particle] the library tomorrow.)
> * **Student:** 에 (to)
> * **Teacher:** Correct. Why?
> * **Student:** Direction/Destination marker.

### Drill C: The "Lego Breakdown" (Comprehension)
**Goal:** Decoding complex sentences instantly.
When a student is stuck, the teacher breaks the sentence into visual "chunks."

> **Original:** 저는 어제 늦게 잤기 때문에 오늘 너무 피곤해요.
> 
> **Teacher Breakdown:**
> 1. 저는 어제 늦게 잤기 때문에 (Because I slept late yesterday...)
> 2. 오늘 (Today)
> 3. 너무 피곤해요 (I am very tired)
> 
> *Student must re-translate chunks 1, 2, and 3 separately.*

## 4. Semantic Logic: Hanja Integration
When a new "concept word" appears, the teacher provides the **Hanja root** as a memory hook.

* **Trigger:** Student asks, "What is Chul-gu (Exit)?"
* **Teacher Response:**
    * "**Chul (출)** = Out / Exit"
    * "**Gu (구)** = Mouth / Opening"
    * "See also: **Chul-bal** (Depart/Start out), **Ip-gu** (Entrance/Enter-mouth)."

## 5. Daily Session Protocol (60 Minutes)

| Phase | Time | Activity | Teacher Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Recall** | 10 min | The "Yesterday" Chat | Casual chat targeting vocab from the previous session. |
| **2. Expansion** | 20 min | Sentence Snowballing | Pick 3 new verbs; perform Drill A until sentences are complex. |
| **3. Input** | 20 min | Media Analysis | Send screenshot/text from Webtoon/Drama. Use Drill C for errors. |
| **4. Anchor** | 10 min | Summary & Hanja | List 5 "Golden Words" + Hanja roots. Student types final sentences. |

## 6. Tools Required (Low Tech)
* **Chat Platform:** Discord, Slack (allows editing and threads), or KakaoTalk.
* **Shared Doc (Teacher Only):** A list of "Words to Re-inject" to ensure the Spaced Repetition occurs naturally.
